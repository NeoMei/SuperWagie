# UI Auth Module Documentation

## Purpose
This module owns OpenChamber UI authentication for browser access, including password session auth, WebAuthn passkeys, and trusted-device session handling.

Trusted-device access has one durable credential model: a remote client bearer token stored by `packages/web/server/lib/client-auth/remote-clients.js`. Password, passkey, and Pairing v2 are issuance methods for that credential, not separate credential systems. Issued client tokens are returned once, stored server-side only as hashes, and are later authenticated via `Authorization: Bearer oc_client_...`.

Pairing v2 is implemented by `packages/web/server/lib/client-auth/pairing.js`. It stores short-lived one-time pairing sessions with hashed secrets, exposes create/cancel/redeem routes under `/api/client-auth/pairing/*`, and redeems a valid pairing secret into the same remote client token used by password/passkey trusted-device flows.

## Entrypoints and structure
- `packages/web/server/lib/ui-auth/ui-auth.js`: UI auth controller runtime, cookie/session issuance, rate limiting, and auth route handlers.
- `packages/web/server/lib/ui-auth/ui-passkeys.js`: passkey store and WebAuthn registration/authentication verification helpers.
- `packages/web/server/lib/ui-auth/session-cookie.js`: resolves the session cookie name from a request's `Host` port; shared by session issuance and validation in `ui-auth.js` and notification/session identity extraction in `packages/web/server/lib/security/request-security.js`.
- `packages/web/server/lib/client-auth/remote-clients.js`: trusted-device client token storage, bearer authentication, last-used tracking, and revocation.
- `packages/web/server/lib/client-auth/pairing.js`: short-lived Pairing v2 sessions and one-time secret redemption into trusted-device client tokens.

## Session cookie scoping
Browsers key a cookie jar on the host only, never the port (RFC 6265). Two OpenChamber instances reached through the same hostname on different ports therefore shared a single `oc_ui_session` cookie. Logging into the second overwrote the first instance's session cookie (issue #2377). This affects LAN and loopback hosts alike.

`sessionCookieNameForRequest(req, base)` folds the request `Host` port into the cookie name: `oc_ui_session_<port>` when the host carries an explicit port (including a port from `x-forwarded-host`), or the bare `oc_ui_session` when it does not. `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001` use separate names, just like two ports on one LAN address. Password and browser passkey login both call `issueSession` and receive this cookie. Session validation, clearing, and notification identity extraction use the same resolver; identity extraction does not provide a CSRF token. Bearer-token validation is unchanged.

Compatibility: upgrading renames the cookie for any explicit-port host, so already-signed-in browser sessions must log in once again. No on-disk format changes.

## URL auth tokens
`POST /auth/url-token` returns `{ token, expiresAt, expiresIn }`. `expiresAt` is on the server's clock; `expiresIn` is the remaining lifetime in milliseconds. The shared UI places the expiry on its own clock from `expiresIn` (`packages/ui/src/lib/runtime-auth.ts`), because a phone whose clock is a minute ahead of the server otherwise treats every fresh token as expired and opens the terminal and event sockets without one (issue #5614). `expiresAt` stays for older clients. Both the active-runtime mint and the cookie-only local-origin mint use the remaining lifetime. Server validation still enforces its stored absolute expiry, path and method scopes, guest scope, captured platform identity and global sign-out invalidation.

## Public exports (ui-auth.js)
- `readSessionTtlMs(raw, unitMs, fallbackMs)`: parses a positive session lifetime from an environment value, else the fallback. Defaults come from `OPENCHAMBER_UI_SESSION_TTL_HOURS` (12) and `OPENCHAMBER_UI_TRUSTED_SESSION_TTL_DAYS` (7, used when the user ticks "trust this device").
- `createUiAuth({ password, cookieName, sessionTtlMs, trustedSessionTtlMs, readSettingsFromDiskMigrated })`: creates UI auth controller with methods:
  - `enabled`
  - `requireAuth(req, res, next)`
  - `handleSessionStatus(req, res)`
  - `handleSessionCreate(req, res)`
  - `handlePasskeyStatus(req, res)`
  - `handlePasskeyRegistrationOptions(req, res)`
  - `handlePasskeyRegistrationVerify(req, res)`
  - `handlePasskeyAuthenticationOptions(req, res)`
  - `handlePasskeyAuthenticationVerify(req, res)`
  - `handlePasskeyList(req, res)`
  - `handlePasskeyRevoke(req, res)`
  - `handlePasskeyRename(req, res)`
  - `handleResetAuth(req, res)`
  - `ensureSessionToken(req, res)`
  - `dispose()`

## Public exports (ui-passkeys.js)
- `createUiPasskeys({ passwordBinding, readSettingsFromDiskMigrated, storeFile, rpName, challengeTtlMs })`: creates passkey runtime with methods:
  - `enabled`
  - `getStatus(req)`
  - `listPasskeys(req)`
  - `revokePasskey(req, passkeyId)`
  - `renamePasskey(req, passkeyId, label)`
  - `clearAllPasskeys()`
  - `beginRegistration(req, { label })`
  - `finishRegistration(payload)`
  - `beginAuthentication(req)`
  - `finishAuthentication(payload)`
  - `dispose()`

## Platform identity boundary

`resolvePlatformAuthContext` is the dedicated identity resolver for UniHub account and model-task routes. An explicit Authorization header controls the result by itself. Only a strictly formed, authenticated device bearer produces a client identity; invalid credentials never fall back to a browser cookie or URL token.

With a UI password, cookie-only platform identity requires the existing signed UI-session verification. Passwordless browser access uses an independent `oc_platform_runtime` cookie with a random value, bounded expiry and an HMAC signature. Its domain-separated signing key derives from the existing private instance JWT secret, so an authenticated browser identity remains verifiable across a backend restart. An untrusted or expired cookie yields a new server-issued identity and can never select a previous platform namespace. Passwordless `requireClientAuth` instances accept device identities only. The generic `resolveAuthContext` behavior remains unchanged for existing consumers.

`resolvePlatformAccessContext` serves the global user gate. It can select a URL token's captured platform identity only after the existing token expiry, method and path scope validation succeeds. Account mutations continue to use `resolvePlatformAuthContext`, which accepts no URL-token identity. Explicit Authorization headers retain sole authority in both resolvers.

## Desktop trusted bearer lifetime

The desktop shell stores its bearer in protected desktop settings and needs it
across packaged restarts. Trusted desktop client bearers therefore use a finite
lifetime with a 30-day floor, independent of the shorter browser cookie. An
explicitly cleared trust preference keeps the shorter session lifetime, and
revocation still removes the device's access.
