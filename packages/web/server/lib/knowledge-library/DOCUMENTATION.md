# Knowledge library

## Ownership

The user-facing feature over the embedded knowledge backend:

- `store.js` — the two JSON files (libraries, document ledger), atomic and
  serialized.
- `scan.js` — what may be indexed, and the directory walk.
- `ingest.js` — reference registration, reparse on change, parse polling.
- `watcher.js` — event hints, debounced reconcile, periodic sweep.
- `search.js` — merged file-name and semantic results.
- `runtime.js` — settings-driven composition: supervisor, provisioning,
  libraries, reconcile/ingest loop, search, content.
- `routes.js` — the HTTP surface for the panel, the settings page and the
  agent tool.

`../embedded-knowledge/` owns the backend process and every wire shape.
`../openchamber-control/library.js` is the agent-facing adapter.

## Invariants

- A document's identity is `(libraryId, relPath)`. The backend knowledge id
  is an attribute that survives a content change, never the identity.
- Only documents in the `ready` state are returned by search, listed as
  openable, or quoted by the agent. A parsing document is invisible rather
  than cited-and-unopenable.
- The absolute path enters the backend only through the reference endpoint
  and is never part of an API response that the backend produced. The panel
  uses the ledger's own path to open the file.
- One knowledge base holds every library; `folder_path` is
  `<library slug>/<directories>`, which is what makes the tree.
- Removing a library deletes its ledger rows, and deletes backend records
  only when the caller asks. It never touches files on disk.
- A file that disappears from disk becomes `missing`; nothing deletes
  records implicitly, and `clean-missing` is the explicit action.
- Secrets (API key, account password) never leave the server; status answers
  carry presence, not values.
- A library root is validated before every scan. A vanished or unreadable
  root fails that library closed and never reads as mass deletion.

## Decisions

### Why one knowledge base and folder paths, not one per library

Cross-library search is the common case, and one backend call serves it. A
knowledge base per library would multiply model configuration and make a
global search an N-call fan-out. The cost is that scoping a search to one
library has to pass its ready documents' ids; that is a ledger lookup, and
the documented upgrade path is a tag per library if ids ever get large.

### Why file-name search runs over the ledger

The backend's `?keyword=` filter matches titles only, and only for documents
it has finished indexing, so it cannot answer "find the file whose name looks
like this" while a folder is still catching up — and it costs a round trip.
The ledger already holds every relative path and state; filtering it is
instant, works while the backend is down, and keeps one input returning both
groups.

### Why a change reparses instead of delete-and-register

The fork's reference records are idempotent per `(knowledge base, path)` and
`POST /knowledge/:id/reparse` re-reads the file in place. Deleting first
would open a window where a citation points at nothing and would change the
knowledge id, which is exactly what citations and the ledger key on.

### Why the ingester is the only module that knows how a file enters the index

Reference ingest is a contract with a forked backend. Keeping registration,
reparse and polling behind `ingest.js` means a different contract — a copy,
a mount, a different fork — replaces one adapter; libraries, the ledger,
search, the panel and the agent tool do not change.

### Why both a watcher and a sweep

`fs.watch` drops events (editor atomic saves, platform quirks) and is not
recursive everywhere. Events are treated as hints that mark a root dirty; a
10-minute sweep runs regardless, so the failure mode of a dropped event is a
delayed update, never a silently stale index.

### Why a freshly written file waits

A file registered while it is still being written is parsed from a partial
body and appears indexed while being wrong. A document whose mtime is under
1.5 seconds old stays `pending`; a later pass promotes it. The hash is
recomputed immediately before the backend call, so a touch that leaves the
content identical costs no reparse.

### Why the workspace panel and the agent share one runtime

Both answer from the same ledger and the same backend. Two owners would drift
on readiness, scoping and error mapping, and the agent would cite documents
the panel does not show.
