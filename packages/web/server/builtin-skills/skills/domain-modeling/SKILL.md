# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `GLOSSARY.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## Existing project glossary

Before creating any GLOSSARY file, read the current project's instructions and existing GLOSSARY-MAP.md or CONTEXT-MAP.md, then inspect the applicable existing glossary. Reuse the selected GLOSSARY.md or CONTEXT.md at its current path. A map's referenced context files remain authoritative regardless of their names. If both naming families exist and the project does not select one, ask which glossary owns the current topic before editing either. Keep user filenames and map links unchanged.

Apply the glossary steps below to the selected existing file. Use [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md) for legacy CONTEXT projects and [GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md](./GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md) for GLOSSARY projects. In SuperWriter, keep glossary work and all delegated context within the current customer workspace.

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` or legacy `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── GLOSSARY.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── GLOSSARY.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. Only when no applicable existing glossary or map exists, create a root `GLOSSARY.md` when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update the selected glossary inline

When a term is resolved, update the selected existing glossary right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format selected in "Existing project glossary".

The selected glossary should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat the glossary as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).
